# Customer-Churn-Prediction-and-Survival-Analysis
In todayâ€™s highly competitive telecommunications industry, customer retention is paramount. Companies are increasingly challenged not only to attract new subscribers but also to maintain their existing customer base in the face of growing competition and changing consumer preferences. One of the most significant indicators of customer dissatisfaction and impending loss is customer churn, which refers to customers discontinuing their service. Understanding and predicting churn is crucial, as acquiring a new customer is significantly more expensive than retaining an existing one.

This project, titled "Customer Survival Analysis and Churn Prediction," aims to leverage advanced analytics to tackle the issue of customer churn within the telecommunications sector. Survival analysis, a statistical method traditionally used to measure the time until an event of interest occurs, is merged with predictive modeling techniques in our study. This dual approach allows us not only to quantify the likelihood and timing of churn but also to identify the underlying factors that contribute to customer attrition. By integrating these methodologies, our study seeks to offer actionable insights that can lead to targeted interventions, thus enhancing customer retention and ensuring sustainable business growth. 

The project employs a comprehensive dataset from the telecommunications industry, comprising demographic information, service usage patterns, and billing details among other attributes, to explore the dynamics of customer loyalty and service continuation. By applying a combination of nonparametric and semi-parametric statistical methods, the study will model the relationship between customer characteristics and their churn behavior over time, offering a predictive outlook that transcends traditional analytical approaches.
